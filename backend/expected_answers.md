## Question 2: What is the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript?

**Category:** technical | **Subcategory:** Programming | **Difficulty:** beginner

**Expected Answer:** In JavaScript, var declares variables that are function-scoped (or globally scoped if declared outside a function) and can be redeclared or updated. let declares block-scoped variables (only accessible inside the nearest {} block) and can be updated but not redeclared within the same scope, making it safer than var. const is also block-scoped but creates a read-only binding — the variable cannot be reassigned after its initial value (though objects or arrays declared with const can still have their contents changed).

## Question 3: Describe a challenging situation you faced and how you handled it.

**Category:** behavioral | **Subcategory:** Problem Solving | **Difficulty:** beginner

**Expected Answer:** In my previous project, we had a very tight deadline to deliver a key module, but midway we discovered a major bug that affected core functionality. Instead of panicking, I broke the problem into smaller parts, coordinated with teammates to divide the debugging tasks, and worked extra hours to test each fix quickly. By prioritizing the most critical issues and keeping communication open with the team and stakeholders, we were able to resolve the bug and still deliver the module on time.

## Question 6: Explain the concept of closures in JavaScript.

**Category:** technical | **Subcategory:** Programming | **Difficulty:** intermediate

**Expected Answer:** In JavaScript, a closure is created when an inner function "remembers" and can access variables from its outer (enclosing) function even after that outer function has finished executing. This happens because functions in JavaScript form their own scope and carry a reference to the environment in which they were created. Closures are widely used to create private data, maintain state between function calls, and implement callbacks or event handlers.

## Question 7: What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?

**Category:** technical | **Subcategory:** Database | **Difficulty:** beginner

**Expected Answer:** SQL databases are relational, use structured schemas, and store data in tables with rows and columns. They are ideal for complex queries and transactions, ensuring data consistency (ACID properties). NoSQL databases are non-relational, schema-less, and store data in formats like documents, key-value pairs, or graphs. They are highly scalable and flexible, making them suitable for handling large volumes of unstructured or rapidly changing data.

## Question 8: Tell me about a time when you had to work with a difficult team member.

**Category:** behavioral | **Subcategory:** Teamwork | **Difficulty:** beginner

**Expected Answer:** In one project, I had a team member who often disagreed with others and resisted suggestions, which slowed progress. I decided to approach the situation calmly by actively listening to their concerns and finding common ground. By involving them in planning decisions and clearly communicating expectations, we were able to collaborate more effectively, complete the project on time, and even incorporate some of their valuable ideas.

## Question 9: How would you handle a situation where you disagree with your manager?

**Category:** situational | **Subcategory:** Problem Solving | **Difficulty:** beginner

**Expected Answer:** If I disagreed with my manager, I would first try to understand their perspective fully. Then, I would present my points respectfully, supported with data or examples, and suggest possible alternatives. Ultimately, I would be open to feedback and follow the final decision, focusing on the success of the project and team.
